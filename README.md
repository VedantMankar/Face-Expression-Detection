# Face-Expression-Detection
## Description
  <br>This Project is built to detect the facial expressions of humans. Today with an increase in AI, various systems have been built on recognizing people's expressions and hence reccomend them some products based on it.The first step to build such systems wis to identify peoples emotions which is performed here.Here a model has been trained on 7 universal expressions which are 1)Happy, 2) Sad , 3)Surprise , 4) Neutral , 5)Angry , 6) Fear, 7)Disgust <br>
  A CNN Model was used to train the images and classify the emotions
  A Haar Cascade classifier was used to detect the face.<br>
 ## Dataset
  <br>The dataset was taken from kaggle challenge for Facial Expression Recognition https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-        challenge
  
  ## Installation
    <text>After downloading the project run the following command<text><br>
    python main.py
